<h4 id="secure">Secure mailbox</h4>

<p>7.1 When you register for the first time, a secure online mailbox will be set up for you on the Government Gateway. Some online services may make use of the secure mailbox to send you communications and replies to email questions. For these services, you can view the contents of your secure mailbox on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p>7.2 You should regularly check your mailbox and delete old messages. Read messages that have been on the system for up to three months from delivery will be archived and removed from your mailbox. Unread messages that have been on the system for up to 12 months from delivery will be archived and removed from your mailbox.</p>

<p>7.3 If you opt to receive statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits, which may include notice to file a tax return, renew your tax credits, make a payment or information about other related matters electronically then these will be delivered to a separate dedicated secure online mailbox. This mailbox is different to the secure mailbox set up for you on the Government Gateway.</p>

<h4 id="8">Statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits</h4>

<p>8.1 Some online services may be used, or may make use of the secure online mailbox, to issue statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits. You can view these securely on the GOV.UK website. You may also print or save them to your own computer. Statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits made available in this way by HMRC will have the same legal effect as paper statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits sent to you by post.</p>

<p>8.2 You will be asked to provide your consent before HMRC issues statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits to you using the secure online mailbox referred to in paragraph 7.3. Where this is the case you will be asked to provide this on screen. If you give your consent you will be required to register an email address with HMRC and HMRC will verify these details with you. When statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits are issued to you using your secure online mailbox, a notification email will also be sent to your registered email address to inform you of this. You should keep the details of your registered email address up-to-date and notify HMRC of any changes.</p>

<p>8.3 If you give the consent referred to in paragraph 8.2 you may also be asked to register a telephone number with HMRC. When statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs and tax credits are issued to you HMRC may also send a text message to this telephone number, or to a daytime telephone number that you have already provided to HMRC, to inform you of this. You should keep the details of your registered telephone number up-to-date and notify HMRC of any changes.</p>

<h4>Online filing services</h4>

<p>9.1 When using HMRC online filing services, you must use either HMRC software or, where available, online filing enabled third party software. The software will prompt you to enter your User ID and password (or Digital Certificate) at the appropriate time to verify your identity and authenticate the information you are sending.</p>

<p>9.2 Some online services allow you to send attachments (for example PDF files) with the return. Any attachments you send with the return must be proper and complete and must be able to be viewed by HMRC. If for any reason HMRC cannot view the contents of the attachments, or they are not proper and complete, the obligation to make a return may not be satisfied. Although HMRC will notify you of this as soon as possible if it happens, HMRC cannot guarantee to do so in time for you to avoid incurring penalties.</p>

<p>9.3 An authenticated tax return, claim, application or form sent over the Internet and accepted by HMRC systems has the same legal validity and implications as a signed paper return, claim, application or form delivered to a HMRC office.</p>

<p>9.4 Some HMRC Online Services require information to be provided in a paper form. You will be told on screen when this is the case and where appropriate, directed to the appropriate downloadable form.</p>

If HMRC does not hold a valid Agent authority from a client you will not be able to use any part of those online services on behalf of that client other than the 'File only' facility that is available for PAYE, Self Assessment or Corporation Tax.</p>

<h4>Registration</h4>

<p>41.1 You can register as an Agent for HMRC Online Services on the GOV.UK or Government Gateway websites.</p>

<p>41.2 If you register on the GOV.UK website, the details you provide will be passed to the Government Gateway for verification (on behalf of HMRC).

You can view the Government Gateway privacy policy on their website.</p>

<p>41.4 If you register on the GOV.UK website, your registration details may also be stored on HMRC systems. You can view the HMRC <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/privacy.htm">Privacy policy</a> on this website.</p>

<h4>User ID and password</h4>

<p>42.1 Your User ID and password (or Digital Certificate) will be used to verify your identity and to authenticate information you send. They will be held securely on the Government Gateway and will not be made available to government departments.</p>

<p>42.2 The Government Gateway uses the postal address registered on relevant HMRC systems to send you the service Activation Code (if required). After the Gateway has sent this information, your address is deleted from the Government Gateway.</p>

<h4>De-registration</h4>

<p>43.1 De-registration from HMRC Online Services must be done either on the Government Gateway or GOV.UK website.</p>

<h4>Login</h4>

<p>44.1 When registered you can login to HMRC Online Services using your User ID and password (or Digital Certificate) via the GOV.UK website. Your encrypted User ID and password (or Digital Certificate) will be passed to the Government Gateway for authentication.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>45.1 You must always keep your User ID and password (or Digital Certificate) safe and secret. You can change your password on the GOV.UK or Government Gateway websites.</p>

<p>45.2 If you forget your User ID, you can ask for it to be re-issued either by post or online, using the GOV.UK website. If you forget your password, you can request a replacement to be sent to you either by post or online using the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p>45.3 If you lose both your User ID and password, you will need to contact the HMRC <a class="new-window" href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/information/helpdesk">Online Services Helpdesk</a> (details are provided on the GOV.UK website).</p>

<p>45.4 For detailed guidance regarding online security and protection, please follow the link <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/security/index.htm">Online security - making your online experience as secure as possible</a>.</p>

<h4>Secure mailbox</h4>

<p>46.1 When you register for the first time, a secure online mailbox will be set up for you on the Government Gateway. Some online services may make use of the secure mailbox to send you communications and replies to email questions. For these services, you can view the contents of your secure mailbox on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p>46.2 You should regularly check your mailbox and delete old messages. Read messages that have been on the system for up to three months from delivery will be archived and removed from your mailbox. Unread messages that have been on the system for up to 12 months from delivery will be archived and removed from your mailbox.</p>

<h4>Statutory notices, reminders and certificates</h4>

<p>47.1 Some online services may be used to issue statutory notices (such as PAYE coding notices) and reminders for your clients, to act on their behalf. You can view the notices and reminders securely on the GOV.UK website, or in most cases using third party software applications. You may also print or save them to your own computer. Statutory notices made available in this way by HMRC will have the same legal validity and implications as a paper statutory notice sent to you by post.</p>

<p>47.2 If you would prefer to continue receiving PAYE notices and reminders, on behalf of a client, by Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or paper, you can opt out of receiving these over the internet. You can do this on the HMRC website by following the 'Change notice options' link from your 'PAYE At a glance' page. However, HMRC reserve the right to continue sending other information, such as customer service messages and information about tax-free payments, to your online mailbox. If you later wish to change preferences, follow 'Change notice options' link from your 'PAYE At a glance' page.</p>

<h4>Online filing services</h4>

<p>48.1 Some HMRC Online Services (for example Self Assessment) allow authorised Agents and their clients to see details of previously filed returns. Agents should be aware that this means that, where a client changes Agent, any new authorised Agent will be able to view returns filed online by any former authorised Agent(s). Where a former Agent has been the nominee to receive a client's tax repayment, the information on the return includes that Agent's bank account and sort code details.</p>

<p>48.2 When using HMRC online filing services, you must use either HMRC software or, where available, online filing enabled third party software. The software will prompt you to enter your User ID and password (or Digital Certificate) at the appropriate time to verify your identity and authenticate the information you are sending.</p>

<p>48.3 Some HMRC Online Services allow you to send attachments (for example PDF files) with the return. Any attachments you send with the return must be proper and complete and must be able to be viewed by HMRC. If for any reason HMRC cannot view the contents of the attachments, or they are not proper and complete, the obligation to make a return may not be satisfied. Although HMRC will notify you of this as soon as possible if it happens, HMRC cannot guarantee to do so in time for you to avoid incurring penalties.</p>

<p>48.4 An authenticated tax return, claim, application or form sent over the internet and accepted by HMRC systems has the same legal validity and implications as a signed paper return, claim, application or form delivered to a HMRC office.</p>

<p>48.5 Some HMRC Online Services require information to be provided in a paper form. You will be told on screen when this is the case and where appropriate, directed to the appropriate downloadable form.</p>

<p>48.6 Company Tax Returns sent using the online filing service must include the required attachments. A form CT600 sent without the required attachments does not satisfy the filing obligation and the company will be treated as not having made a return.</p>

<p>48.7 Before you send your client's tax return, claim or application you must make a copy and ask them to make a declaration confirming that the content of the return, claim or application is correct to the best of their knowledge and belief. You may then submit the return, claim or application. HMRC advise you, or your client, to keep the copy of the return, claim or application and your client's declaration confirming that the information is correct to the best of their knowledge and belief.</p>

<p>48.8 Where your client is a company, you may complete the declaration on behalf of that client company if the company has authorised you to do so. In such cases you do not need to make a copy of the information before it is sent.</p>
